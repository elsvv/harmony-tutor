# Imaj7 → vi7 → ii7 → V7 (Jazz turnaround)

## Overview

**I–vi–ii–V** is a classic jazz **turnaround** — a loopable phrase ending that naturally brings the harmony back to I. Think of it as a small orbit around the tonic: tonic → tonic substitute (vi) → predominant (ii) → dominant (V).

## How to read the labels

-   `Imaj7` — the tonic on **scale degree 1**; `maj7` means a **major 7th** above the root.
-   `vi7` — a chord on **scale degree 6**; lowercase `vi` means minor quality, and `7` means a seventh chord.
-   `ii7` — a chord on **scale degree 2**; lowercase `ii` means minor quality, and `7` means a seventh chord.
-   `V7` — the dominant on **scale degree 5**; `7` means a dominant 7th chord.

## Structure

| Step | Degree | Chord quality | Role             |
| ---- | ------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 1    | I      | maj7          | tonic            |
| 2    | vi     | m7            | tonic substitute |
| 3    | ii     | m7            | predominant      |
| 4    | V      | 7             | dominant         |

## Why it works

-   **vi7** shares tones with I, so it feels related but less stable
-   **ii7 → V7** is a classic build-up of tension
-   **V7** strongly wants to resolve to **Imaj7**, making the progression easy to cycle

## Practice tips

-   aim for minimal motion in the upper voices
-   listen for how the **7ths** in each chord tend to resolve

_Tip: in real tunes, vi7 is often replaced by VI7 (a secondary dominant), but learning the diatonic version first is very useful._

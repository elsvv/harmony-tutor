# T64 → S6 → II43-harm → VII2-harm → D7 → T3

## Progression overview

The most **dramatic** of the basic sequences. It starts with an unstable tonic 6-4, passes through the predominant and leading-tone inversions, reaches a full dominant 7th, and ends with an open, incomplete tonic.

## How to read the labels

-   `T64` — tonic (`T`) in second inversion (`64`, a 6-4 chord).
-   `S6` — subdominant (`S`) in first inversion (`6`, a six chord).
-   `II43-harm` — II-degree 7th chord (`II`) in `43` inversion (second inversion) with `-harm` = **harmonic major** (lowered 6th degree, ♭6).
-   `VII2-harm` — leading-tone diminished 7th chord (`VII`) in `2` inversion (third inversion) with `-harm` = the **harmonic major** variant.
-   `D7` — dominant (`D`) as a root-position 7th chord (`7`).
-   `T3` — incomplete tonic triad (`T`): usually only scale degrees 1 and 3 (the 5th is omitted).

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord     | Function           | Bass degree |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | T64       | Tonic              | V           |
| 2    | S6        | Subdominant        | VI          |
| 3    | II43-harm | Predominant-harm   | VI          |
| 4    | VII2-harm | Dominant-harm      | VI          |
| 5    | D7        | Dominant           | V           |
| 6    | T3        | Tonic (incomplete) | I           |

## Unique features

### VII2-harm — third inversion of the leading-tone 7th

This inversion often sounds the sharpest:

-   the 7th is in the bass (harmonic-major lowered 6th)
-   maximum half-step pull toward resolution

### Three chords over scale degree VI

S6, II43-harm and VII2-harm form a **cluster over VI**. Within the progression the 6th degree can be “darkened” (lowered) in harmonic major, creating a chromatic shift.

## Why T3 at the end?

After high tension, an incomplete tonic triad:

-   feels **not fully closed**
-   creates a contrast of density: rich 7th chords → open sonority
-   leaves space for continuation

## Voice-leading checkpoints

-   **II43-harm → VII2-harm**: many common tones; the leading tone emerges
-   **VII2-harm → D7**: lowered VI → V in the bass is a key moment
-   **D7 → T3**: leading tone resolves to I; the 7th resolves downward

## Practical advice

1. play **T64** lightly (it is a preparation)
2. highlight the chromatic “darkening” around degree VI
3. don’t rush the **VII2-harm → D7** shift
4. let **T3** ring as an open ending

_Tip: think of this progression as a small story: uncertainty → tension → release, but not a final full stop._

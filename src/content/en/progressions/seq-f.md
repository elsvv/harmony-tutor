# T64 → S6 → II43 → VII2 → D7 → T3

## Progression overview

The most **dramatic** of the basic sequences. It starts with an unstable tonic 6-4, passes through the predominant and leading-tone inversions, reaches a full dominant 7th, and ends with an open, incomplete tonic.

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord | Function           | Bass degree |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | T64   | Tonic              | V           |
| 2    | S6    | Subdominant        | VI          |
| 3    | II43  | Predominant-harm   | VI          |
| 4    | VII2  | Dominant-harm      | VI          |
| 5    | D7    | Dominant           | V           |
| 6    | T3    | Tonic (incomplete) | I           |

## Unique features

### VII2 — third inversion of the leading-tone 7th

This inversion often sounds the sharpest:

-   the 7th is in the bass (harmonic-major lowered 6th)
-   maximum half-step pull toward resolution

### Three chords over scale degree VI

S6, II43 and VII2 form a **cluster over VI**. Within the progression the 6th degree can be “darkened” (lowered) in harmonic major, creating a chromatic shift.

## Why T3 at the end?

After high tension, an incomplete tonic triad:

-   feels **not fully closed**
-   creates a contrast of density: rich 7th chords → open sonority
-   leaves space for continuation

## Voice-leading checkpoints

-   **II43 → VII2**: many common tones; the leading tone emerges
-   **VII2 → D7**: lowered VI → V in the bass is a key moment
-   **D7 → T3**: leading tone resolves to I; the 7th resolves downward

## Practical advice

1. play **T64** lightly (it is a preparation)
2. highlight the chromatic “darkening” around degree VI
3. don’t rush the **VII2 → D7** shift
4. let **T3** ring as an open ending

_Tip: think of this progression as a small story: uncertainty → tension → release, but not a final full stop._

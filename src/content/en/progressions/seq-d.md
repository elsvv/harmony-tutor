# T53 → S64 → II2 → VII7 → D65 → T53

## Progression overview

A longer functional chain where the predominant area is intensified: after II2, the sequence moves through the **leading-tone 7th chord** (VII7, harmonic major color) before reaching the dominant and resolving to the tonic.

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord | Function           | Bass degree |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | T53   | Tonic              | I           |
| 2    | S64   | Subdominant        | I           |
| 3    | II2   | Predominant-harm   | I           |
| 4    | VII7  | Dominant-harm      | VII         |
| 5    | D65   | Dominant           | VII         |
| 6    | T53   | Tonic (resolution) | I           |

## What to listen for

### Two-stage dominant pull

-   **VII7** contains strong half-step tendencies (especially the lowered 6th in harmonic major)
-   **D65** reinforces the dominant function and clarifies the cadence

### Pedal-point start

As in progression A, the bass can remain on I for the first three chords, building tension above a stable foundation.

## Practical use

This progression is useful for practicing:

-   harmonic major color (lowered 6th degree)
-   leading-tone 7th chord resolution
-   extended cadential preparation

_Tip: make the half-step resolutions clear — they are what make the harmonic-major dominant sound “sharp” and dramatic._

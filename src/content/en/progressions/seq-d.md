# T53 → S64 → II2-harm → VII7-harm → D65 → T53

## Progression overview

A longer functional chain where the predominant area is intensified: after II2-harm, the sequence moves through the **leading-tone 7th chord** (VII7-harm, harmonic major color) before reaching the dominant and resolving to the tonic.

## How to read the labels

-   `T53` — tonic (`T`) in root-position triad (`53`).
-   `S64` — subdominant (`S`) in second inversion (`64`, a 6-4 chord).
-   `II2-harm` — II-degree 7th chord (`II`) in `2` inversion (third inversion) with `-harm` = **harmonic major** (lowered 6th degree, ♭6).
-   `VII7-harm` — leading-tone diminished 7th chord (`VII7`) with `-harm` = the **harmonic major** variant.
-   `D65` — dominant (`D`) in `65` inversion (first inversion of a 7th chord).

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord     | Function           | Bass degree |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | T53       | Tonic              | I           |
| 2    | S64       | Subdominant        | I           |
| 3    | II2-harm  | Predominant-harm   | I           |
| 4    | VII7-harm | Dominant-harm      | VII         |
| 5    | D65       | Dominant           | VII         |
| 6    | T53       | Tonic (resolution) | I           |

## What to listen for

### Two-stage dominant pull

-   **VII7-harm** contains strong half-step tendencies (especially the lowered 6th in harmonic major)
-   **D65** reinforces the dominant function and clarifies the cadence

### Pedal-point start

As in progression A, the bass can remain on I for the first three chords, building tension above a stable foundation.

## Practical use

This progression is useful for practicing:

-   harmonic major color (lowered 6th degree)
-   leading-tone 7th chord resolution
-   extended cadential preparation

_Tip: make the half-step resolutions clear — they are what make the harmonic-major dominant sound “sharp” and dramatic._

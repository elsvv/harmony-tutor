# ii7 → V7 → Imaj7 (Jazz cadence)

## Overview

**ii–V–I** is the most important and most common jazz harmonic formula. You’ll find it in standards, bebop, ballads — basically everywhere. Compared to classical harmony, the main difference is the “jazz shell”: **seventh chords**.

## How to read the labels

-   `ii7` — a chord on **scale degree 2** in major; lowercase `ii` means minor quality, and `7` means it’s a **seventh chord**.
-   `V7` — the dominant on **scale degree 5**; `7` means a dominant 7th chord (the 7th adds tension).
-   `Imaj7` — the tonic on **scale degree 1**; `maj7` means a **major 7th** above the root.

For example, in C major: **Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7**.

## Structure

| Step | Degree | Chord quality | Function    |
| ---- | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | ii     | m7            | predominant |
| 2    | V      | 7             | dominant    |
| 3    | I      | maj7          | tonic       |

## What to listen for

-   **ii7** prepares the dominant: a smooth move toward tension
-   **V7** creates strong pull (leading tone + tritone)
-   **Imaj7** is a “jazzy” tonic: stable but colored by the major 7th

## Practice tips

1. Start with root-position voicings (play all chord tones).
2. Try to keep common tones between chords — that’s the core of jazz voice leading.
3. When it feels easy, move chords with minimal voice motion.

_Tip: many other progressions can be understood as chains of ii–V–I cadences._

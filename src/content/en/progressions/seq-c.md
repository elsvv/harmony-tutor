# T64 → S6 → II43 → D7 → T3

## Progression overview

A compact and very typical functional move: a tonic **6-4** (unstable) shifts into the subdominant area, then through the II-degree 7th chord to a clear dominant (D7), finishing with an **incomplete tonic** (T3).

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord | Function           | Bass degree |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | T64   | Tonic (unstable)   | V           |
| 2    | S6    | Subdominant        | VI          |
| 3    | II43  | Subdominant-harm   | VI          |
| 4    | D7    | Dominant           | V           |
| 5    | T3    | Tonic (incomplete) | I           |

## Why it works

### T64 as a preparation

The tonic 6-4 often behaves like a **pre-dominant decoration**: it is “tonic” by notes, but “unstable” by function.

### Common-tone connection on VI

S6 and II43 share the bass on **scale degree VI**, creating a smooth predominant area before the dominant arrives.

## Voice-leading highlights

-   the 7th in **II43** resolves down by step
-   the leading tone in **D7** resolves into scale degree I
-   **T3** omits the 5th, giving an open, “unfinished” sonority

## Practical use

Use this progression to:

-   create a clear cadence with a softer ending
-   practice 7th-chord inversions (especially 4-3)
-   hear the difference between tonic-as-notes vs tonic-as-function (T64)

_Tip: treat T64 as “unstable tonic” and listen for how strongly D7 pulls toward T._

# T6 → S53 → II65-harm → VII43-harm → D2 → T6

## Progression overview

A refined variant of progression B: after II65-harm the harmony passes through the **leading-tone 4-3 inversion** (VII43-harm, harmonic major color), increasing dominant tension before resolving.

## How to read the labels

-   `T6` — tonic (`T`) in first inversion (`6`, a six chord).
-   `S53` — subdominant (`S`) in root-position triad (`53`).
-   `II65-harm` — II-degree 7th chord (`II`) in `65` inversion (first inversion) with `-harm` = **harmonic major** (lowered 6th degree, ♭6).
-   `VII43-harm` — leading-tone diminished 7th chord (`VII`) in `43` inversion (second inversion) with `-harm` = the **harmonic major** variant.
-   `D2` — dominant (`D`) in `2` inversion (third inversion of a 7th chord).

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord      | Function         | Bass degree |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | T6         | Tonic            | III         |
| 2    | S53        | Subdominant      | IV          |
| 3    | II65-harm  | Predominant-harm | IV          |
| 4    | VII43-harm | Dominant-harm    | IV          |
| 5    | D2         | Dominant         | IV          |
| 6    | T6         | Tonic            | III         |

## Why it works

### A stable bass, changing tension

Keeping the bass on **IV** through the middle of the sequence creates continuity while the upper voices intensify the dominant pull.

### Harmonic-major dominant color

The harmonic-major variants (lowered 6th degree) sharpen the half-step tendencies and make the cadence feel more dramatic.

## Practice focus

-   hear the difference between **II65-harm** (predominant) and **VII43-harm** (dominant)
-   keep voice leading smooth: 7ths resolve downward by step
-   prepare the final return to **T6** without “breaking” the bass line

_Tip: treat the middle (II65-harm → VII43-harm → D2) as a single dominant-preparation ramp._

# T6 → S53 → II65 → VII43 → D2 → T6

## Progression overview

A refined variant of progression B: after II65 the harmony passes through the **leading-tone 4-3 inversion** (VII43, harmonic major color), increasing dominant tension before resolving.

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord | Function         | Bass degree |
| ---- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | T6    | Tonic            | III         |
| 2    | S53   | Subdominant      | IV          |
| 3    | II65  | Predominant-harm | IV          |
| 4    | VII43 | Dominant-harm    | IV          |
| 5    | D2    | Dominant         | IV          |
| 6    | T6    | Tonic            | III         |

## Why it works

### A stable bass, changing tension

Keeping the bass on **IV** through the middle of the sequence creates continuity while the upper voices intensify the dominant pull.

### Harmonic-major dominant color

The harmonic-major variants (lowered 6th degree) sharpen the half-step tendencies and make the cadence feel more dramatic.

## Practice focus

-   hear the difference between **II65** (predominant) and **VII43** (dominant)
-   keep voice leading smooth: 7ths resolve downward by step
-   prepare the final return to **T6** without “breaking” the bass line

_Tip: treat the middle (II65 → VII43 → D2) as a single dominant-preparation ramp._

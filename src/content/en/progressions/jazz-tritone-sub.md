# Tritone substitution in ii–V–I: ii7 → bII7 → Imaj7

## Overview

A **tritone substitution** is one of the most important jazz devices: replace **V7** with a dominant 7th chord whose root is a tritone away.

So **V7 → I** becomes **bII7 → I**.

In C major:

-   regular: **Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7**
-   tritone sub: **Dm7 → Db7 → Cmaj7**

## How to read the labels

-   `ii7` — a chord on **scale degree 2** in major; lowercase `ii` means minor quality, and `7` means a seventh chord.
-   `bII7` — a dominant 7th chord on the **lowered 2nd degree**; `b` means ♭ (flat), `7` means dominant 7th.
-   `Imaj7` — the tonic on **scale degree 1**; `maj7` means a **major 7th** above the root.

_Note: “bII7” is the same as ♭II7 — just written with the letter `b`._

## Why it works

-   V7 and bII7 share the crucial guide tones: **3rd and 7th**
-   bII7 resolves down by a half-step into I, giving very strong pull

## Practice

-   in every key, locate the pair: V7 ↔ bII7
-   alternate ii–V–I and ii–bII–I and compare the tension → release

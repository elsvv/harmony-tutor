# Tritone substitution in ii–V–I: ii7 → ♭II7 → Imaj7

## Overview

A **tritone substitution** is one of the most important jazz devices: replace **V7** with a dominant 7th chord whose root is a tritone away.

So **V7 → I** becomes **♭II7 → I**.

In C major:

-   regular: **Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7**
-   tritone sub: **Dm7 → Db7 → Cmaj7**

## Why it works

-   V7 and ♭II7 share the crucial guide tones: **3rd and 7th**
-   ♭II7 resolves down by a half-step into I, giving very strong pull

## Practice

-   in every key, locate the pair: V7 ↔ ♭II7
-   alternate ii–V–I and ii–♭II–I and compare the tension → release

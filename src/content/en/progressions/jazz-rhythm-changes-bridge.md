# Rhythm changes bridge (dominant chain): V/vi → V/ii → V/V → V7

## Overview

In **Rhythm Changes** (based on I Got Rhythm), the bridge often uses a **dominant chain** moving around the circle of fifths:

-   **V/vi → V/ii → V/V → V7**

## How to read the labels

-   `V/vi` — a **secondary dominant**: the dominant (V7) of the `vi` chord.
-   `V/ii` — the dominant of the `ii` chord.
-   `V/V` — the dominant of the dominant.
-   `V7` — the main dominant in the key (a dominant 7th chord).

_Note: you may also see this chain written as III7 → VI7 → II7 → V7. Here the labels use the slash form: `V/vi → V/ii → V/V → V7`._

In C major:

-   **E7 → A7 → D7 → G7**

## Why it matters

-   dominant chains are a core engine of jazz harmonic motion
-   it’s a great exercise for hearing dominant resolutions and preparing ii–V–I

## Practice

1. Play the chain in different keys.
2. Aim for minimal motion in the guide tones (3rd and 7th).
3. After V7, resolve to Imaj7.

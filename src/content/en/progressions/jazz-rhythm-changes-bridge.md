# Rhythm changes bridge (dominant chain): III7 → VI7 → II7 → V7

## Overview

In **Rhythm Changes** (based on I Got Rhythm), the bridge often uses a **dominant chain** moving around the circle of fifths:

-   **III7 → VI7 → II7 → V7**

In C major:

-   **E7 → A7 → D7 → G7**

## Why it matters

-   dominant chains are a core engine of jazz harmonic motion
-   it’s a great exercise for hearing dominant resolutions and preparing ii–V–I

## Practice

1. Play the chain in different keys.
2. Aim for minimal motion in the guide tones (3rd and 7th).
3. After V7, resolve to Imaj7.

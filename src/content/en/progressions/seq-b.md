# T6 → S53 → II65 → D2 → T6

## Progression overview

A variant of the classical pattern that **starts in first inversion** (a “six chord”). This creates a softer, more “floating” character compared to a root-position opening.

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord | Function         | Bass degree |
| ---- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | T6    | Tonic            | III         |
| 2    | S53   | Subdominant      | IV          |
| 3    | II65  | Subdominant-harm | IV          |
| 4    | D2    | Dominant         | IV          |
| 5    | T6    | Tonic            | III         |

## Features

### Bass line

Unlike progression A, the bass is more melodic:

-   **III → IV**: stepwise ascent
-   **IV** is held through S53, II65, D2
-   **IV → III**: stepwise descent into the resolution

### Why T6 instead of T53?

The tonic in first inversion:

-   sounds **less final** than root position
-   suggests **continuation** rather than closure
-   works well **mid-phrase** or as part of a longer sequence

### Pedal on scale degree IV

The three central chords (S53, II65, D2) keep **scale degree IV in the bass**, which:

-   smooths the connection between chords
-   highlights the subdominant area
-   makes the final D2 → T6 resolution especially expressive

## Voice leading

Listen for the smooth motion in the upper voices:

-   the 7th in **II65** resolves down by step
-   the leading tone in **D2** resolves up into the tonic

## Where you meet it

-   **song forms**: endings that feel “not quite final”
-   **modulatory passages**: T6 can be reinterpreted in a new key
-   **polyphony**: the moving bass supports a clear contrapuntal line

## Comparison with progression A

| Feature     | Progression A   | Progression B            |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Opening     | stable (T53)    | mobile (T6)              |
| Character   | assertive       | soft, floating           |
| Finality    | full            | relative                 |
| Bass motion | static → motion | motion → static → motion |

_Tip: compare the sound of T53 vs T6 — the six chord often feels like an invitation to continue._

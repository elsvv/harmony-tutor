# Backdoor cadence: ivm7 → ♭VII7 → Imaj7

## Overview

The **backdoor cadence** is a common way to resolve to the tonic **without V7**. Instead of the regular **ii–V–I**, it uses the “plagal side” motion: **ivm7 → ♭VII7 → I**.

In C major:

-   **Fm7 → Bb7 → Cmaj7**

## Why it works

-   ♭VII7 shares tones and a similar dominant pull to an altered V7
-   ♭VII7 → I gives strong stepwise (often semitone) voice-leading into the tonic

## Practice

1. Play ivm7–♭VII7–Imaj7 in all keys.
2. Listen to how the **3rd and 7th** of ♭VII7 want to resolve.
3. Compare the sound to a regular **ii–V–I**.

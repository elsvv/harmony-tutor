# Backdoor cadence: ivm7 → bVII7 → Imaj7

## Overview

The **backdoor cadence** is a common way to resolve to the tonic **without V7**. Instead of the regular **ii–V–I**, it uses the “plagal side” motion: **ivm7 → bVII7 → I**.

In C major:

-   **Fm7 → Bb7 → Cmaj7**

## How to read the labels

-   `ivm7` — a minor 7th chord on **scale degree 4**; lowercase `iv` indicates minor quality, `m7` indicates a minor 7th chord quality.
-   `bVII7` — a dominant 7th chord on the **lowered 7th degree**; `b` means ♭ (flat), `7` means dominant 7th.
-   `Imaj7` — the tonic on **scale degree 1**; `maj7` means a **major 7th** above the root.

_Note: in print you often see ♭VII7 — here the label uses the ASCII form `bVII7`._

## Why it works

-   bVII7 shares tones and a similar dominant pull to an altered V7
-   bVII7 → I gives strong stepwise (often semitone) voice-leading into the tonic

## Practice

1. Play ivm7–bVII7–Imaj7 in all keys.
2. Listen to how the **3rd and 7th** of bVII7 want to resolve.
3. Compare the sound to a regular **ii–V–I**.

# T53 → S64 → II2-harm → D65 → T53

## Progression overview

This classic harmonic sequence is a complete functional cycle **T–S–D–T** (Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic), using the **II degree** as a representative of the subdominant (predominant) group.

## How to read the labels

-   `T53` — tonic (`T`) in root-position triad (`53`).
-   `S64` — subdominant (`S`) in second inversion (`64`, a 6-4 chord).
-   `II2-harm` — II-degree 7th chord (`II`) in `2` inversion (third inversion) with `-harm` = **harmonic major** (lowered 6th degree, ♭6).
-   `D65` — dominant (`D`) in `65` inversion (first inversion of a 7th chord).

## Structure and logic

| Step | Chord    | Function           | Bass degree |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | T53      | Tonic (stable)     | I           |
| 2    | S64      | Subdominant        | I           |
| 3    | II2-harm | Subdominant-harm   | I           |
| 4    | D65      | Dominant           | VII         |
| 5    | T53      | Tonic (resolution) | I           |

## Why it works

### Voice leading

Notice that the **bass stays on the same pitch** through the first three chords. This creates a **tonic pedal point**, stabilizing the opening and making the move to the dominant more dramatic.

### Harmonic tension

-   **T53 → S64**: a gentle move away from stability; the 6-4 chord adds mild instability
-   **S64 → II2-harm**: stronger predominant pull; the 7th increases tension
-   **II2-harm → D65**: a textbook predominant → dominant resolution (fifths-cycle logic)
-   **D65 → T53**: an authentic cadence — the strongest tonal resolution

### Harmonic major color

Here **II2-harm** uses **harmonic major** (lowered 6th degree), which:

-   creates a diminished 5th inside the II-degree chord
-   strengthens the pull toward the dominant
-   adds a subtle “minor shade” inside a major context

## Historical context

This pattern is a foundation of **18th–19th century functional harmony**. You can hear it in:

-   **J.S. Bach** — chorale harmonizations
-   **W.A. Mozart** — piano sonatas
-   **L. Beethoven** — slow movements

## Practical use

Use this progression to:

-   open and close musical phrases
-   create a clear sense of “coming home”
-   establish a key at the beginning of a piece

_Tip: play slowly and listen to how each chord “leans” into the next. That pull is the heart of functional harmony._

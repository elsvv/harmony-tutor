# ♭VII7 — Backdoor dominant

## How to read the label

`♭VII7` (app label: `bVII7`) breaks down as:

-   `♭VII` / `bVII` — the **flattened 7th scale degree** (scale degree 7 lowered by a semitone).
-   `7` — a **dominant seventh** chord quality (major triad + minor 7th).

## What it is

**♭VII7** is a dominant seventh chord built on the flattened 7th degree in a major key. In jazz it’s commonly used as a **backdoor dominant** — an alternative path to the tonic **without V7**.

In C major:

-   ♭VII7 = **Bb7**

## Typical resolution

-   ivm7 → ♭VII7 → Imaj7

(In C major: Fm7 → Bb7 → Cmaj7)

## Why it works

♭VII7 has strong stepwise (often semitone) voice-leading into I, especially in the guide tones (3rd and 7th).

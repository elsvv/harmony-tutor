# D2 — Dominant seventh in third inversion (2 chord)

## Structure

Third inversion of D7 (the 7th is in the bass):

-   **IV** — in the bass (7th)
-   **V**
-   **VII**
-   **II**

## Function

Dominant tension with an especially strong tendency:

-   the bass (IV, the 7th) typically resolves **down by step** to III

## Practical note

Treat the bass as a prepared suspension-like tone: it really wants to resolve downward.

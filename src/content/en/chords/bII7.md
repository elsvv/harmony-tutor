# ♭II7 — Tritone substitution dominant

## What it is

**♭II7** is a dominant seventh chord built on the flattened 2nd degree. In jazz it’s most often used as a **tritone substitution** for V7.

In C major:

-   V7 = G7
-   ♭II7 = Db7

## Typical resolution

-   ♭II7 → Imaj7

Often inside:

-   ii7 → ♭II7 → Imaj7

## Why it works

V7 and ♭II7 share the crucial guide tones (3rd and 7th), so their pull toward the tonic is very similar.

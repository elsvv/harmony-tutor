# II2 — Supertonic seventh chord, third inversion (2 chord)

## How to read the label

`II2` breaks down as:

-   `II` — the scale degree (supertonic), used here as a predominant sonority.
-   `2` — the “2 chord” inversion of a 7th chord (third inversion): the **7th** is in the bass; the figure highlights the interval of a **2nd** above the bass.

## Structure

Third inversion of the II-degree seventh chord (harmonic major color is typically used in these lessons):

-   **I** — in the bass (the 7th of the chord)
-   **II** — root
-   **IV** — 3rd
-   **♭VI** — 5th (lowered 6th degree)

## Function

A strong **predominant** sonority:

-   keeps tonic scale degree in the bass (pedal-point effect)
-   intensifies the pull toward the dominant

## Practical note

The characteristic color is the half-step tendency **♭VI → V** when moving into dominant harmony.

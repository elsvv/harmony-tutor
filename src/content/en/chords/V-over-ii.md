# V/ii — Secondary dominant to ii

## What it is

**V/ii** is a dominant 7th chord that resolves to the **ii** chord.

In C major:

-   V/ii = **A7**
-   ii = **Dm7**

## Where you hear it

-   the Rhythm Changes bridge (as part of a dominant chain)

## Tip

Listen for circle-of-fifths motion: each dominant wants to fall a 5th to the next chord.

# V/ii — Secondary dominant to ii

## How to read the label

`V/ii` breaks down as:

-   `V` — the dominant chord.
-   `/ii` — “of ii”: the target chord is `ii`.

So `V/ii` means “dominant of ii” (a secondary dominant): it’s typically a dominant 7th chord that resolves to `ii`.

## What it is

**V/ii** is a dominant 7th chord that resolves to the **ii** chord.

In C major:

-   V/ii = **A7**
-   ii = **Dm7**

## Where you hear it

-   turnarounds (often as added dominants)
-   the Rhythm Changes bridge (as part of a dominant chain)

## Tip

Listen for circle-of-fifths motion: each dominant wants to fall a 5th to the next chord.

# V/V — Dominant of the dominant

## How to read the label

`V/V` breaks down as:

-   `V` — the dominant chord.
-   `/V` — “of V”: the target chord is `V`.

So `V/V` means “dominant of the dominant” (a secondary dominant): it’s typically a dominant 7th chord that resolves to `V7`.

## What it is

**V/V** is a dominant 7th chord that resolves to **V7**.

In C major:

-   V/V = **D7**
-   V7 = **G7**

## Where you hear it

-   the Rhythm Changes bridge
-   cadences and dominant chains

## Why it’s useful

It’s one of the most common ways to increase momentum toward the dominant and get a more “jazzy” pull.

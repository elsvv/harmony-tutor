# VII2-harm — Leading-tone 2 chord in harmonic major

## How to read the label

`VII2-harm` breaks down as:

-   `VII` — the scale degree (leading tone).
-   `2` — the “2 chord” inversion of a 7th chord (third inversion): the **7th** is in the bass; the figure highlights the interval of a **2nd** above the bass.
-   `-harm` — harmonic major color: the lowered 6th degree (♭6) is used and (in this inversion) appears in the bass, creating the characteristic half-step **♭6 → 5**.

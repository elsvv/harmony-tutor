# V7 — Dominant seventh (jazz context)

## How to read the label

`V7` can be read as:

-   `V` — scale degree 5 (the dominant).
-   `7` — a dominant seventh chord quality (major triad + minor 7th).

## Role in jazz

**V7** is the main source of tension before the tonic. In jazz it appears everywhere: cadences, turnarounds, chains of dominants.

## What to listen for

-   the **tritone** inside V7 is the signature tension
-   the **leading tone** pulls toward the tonic

## Typical resolution

Most often:

-   V7 → Imaj7

_Tip: for a more “jazzy” sound, start with a shell voicing (just 3rd and 7th). Those tones carry the function._

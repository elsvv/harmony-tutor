# S64 — Subdominant 6-4 (second inversion)

## How to read the label

`S64` can be read as:

-   `S` — subdominant / predominant function.
-   `64` — second inversion triad (“6-4”): intervals of a **6th** and **4th** above the bass; the **5th** of the chord is in the bass.

## Structure

Second inversion of the subdominant triad:

-   **I** — in the bass
-   **IV**
-   **VI**

## Function

A subdominant sonority **over tonic bass**:

-   creates a pedal-point feeling
-   increases tension above a stable foundation

## Practical note

Very effective as part of a longer predominant build-up before the dominant.

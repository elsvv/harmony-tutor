# Imaj7 — Tonic major seventh chord

`Imaj7` breaks down as:

-   `I` — scale degree 1 (the tonic).
-   `maj7` — major seventh chord quality: major triad + a **major** 7th.

## Role in jazz

**Imaj7** is a very common jazz tonic: stable, but richer and more colored than a plain triad.

## Interval content

Major seventh chord: 1–3–5–7.

## Sound

The major 7th adds a feeling of:

-   openness
-   gentle color without forcing motion

_Tip: in jazz, the tonic is often expressed as maj7 rather than a simple triad._

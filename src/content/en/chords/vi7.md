# vi7 — Minor seventh chord on scale degree VI

## How to read the label

`vi7` breaks down as:

-   `vi` — scale degree VI written in **lowercase**, which indicates a **minor** chord quality.
-   `7` — a 7th chord (a 7th is added). In major keys this is typically a **minor seventh** chord (m7).

## Role in jazz

In major keys, **vi7** often acts as a **tonic substitute**: it shares tones with I, but feels less stable.

## Typical context

In the classic turnaround:

-   Imaj7 → vi7 → ii7 → V7

## Interval content

_Tip: hear vi7 as a soft move away from I before heading into ii–V._

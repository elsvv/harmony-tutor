# vi7 — Minor seventh chord on scale degree VI

## Role in jazz

In major keys, **vi7** often acts as a **tonic substitute**: it shares tones with I, but feels less stable.

## Typical context

In the classic turnaround:

-   Imaj7 → vi7 → ii7 → V7

## Interval content

Minor seventh chord: 1–♭3–5–♭7.

_Tip: hear vi7 as a soft move away from I before heading into ii–V._

# VII7-harm — Leading-tone seventh chord in harmonic major

## How to read the label

`VII7-harm` breaks down as:

-   `VII` — the scale degree (leading tone): the chord is built on degree 7.
-   `7` — a 7th chord in root position (the chord root is in the bass).
-   `-harm` — harmonic major color: the lowered 6th degree (♭6) is used, which turns the leading-tone chord into a **fully diminished seventh** (°7) and increases tension.

## Structure

In harmonic major the leading-tone 7th chord becomes **fully diminished**:

-   **VII** — in the bass
-   **II**
-   **IV**
-   **♭VI** — lowered 6th (key color)

## Symmetry

Fully diminished 7th chords are built from stacked minor thirds, so the chord is symmetric and can be enharmonically reinterpreted.

## Practical note

Listen for the “floating” quality until it resolves.

# VII7-harm — Leading-tone seventh chord in harmonic major

## Structure

In harmonic major the leading-tone 7th chord becomes **fully diminished**:

-   **VII** — in the bass
-   **II**
-   **IV**
-   **♭VI** — lowered 6th (key color)

## Symmetry

Fully diminished 7th chords are built from stacked minor thirds, so the chord is symmetric and can be enharmonically reinterpreted.

## Practical note

Listen for the “floating” quality until it resolves.

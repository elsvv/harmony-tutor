# T3 — Incomplete tonic triad

## Structure

An **incomplete** tonic triad (often used as a lighter ending):

-   **I**
-   **III**

(5th is omitted.)

## Function

**Tonic**, but with an **open / unfinished** color due to missing the fifth.

## Practical note

After a strong dominant (D7), T3 can sound like resolution without full closure.

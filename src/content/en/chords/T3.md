# T3 — Incomplete tonic triad

## How to read the label

`T3` can be read as:

-   `T` — tonic function (resolution).
-   `3` — an **incomplete** tonic triad: typically only scale degrees **1 and 3** are present (root + third), with the 5th omitted.

## Structure

An **incomplete** tonic triad (often used as a lighter ending):

-   **I**
-   **III**

(5th is omitted.)

## Function

**Tonic**, but with an **open / unfinished** color due to missing the fifth.

## Practical note

After a strong dominant (D7), T3 can sound like resolution without full closure.

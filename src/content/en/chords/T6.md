# T6 — Tonic in first inversion

## How to read the label

`T6` can be read as:

-   `T` — tonic function.
-   `6` — first inversion triad (“6 chord”): the **3rd** of the chord is in the bass; the figure highlights the interval of a **6th** above the bass (the 3rd is implied).

## Structure

**First inversion** tonic triad (the third is in the bass):

-   **III** — in the bass
-   **V**
-   **I**

## Interval content (from the bass)

-   a 3rd
-   a 6th

## Function

Still **tonic**, but typically:

-   softer / less final than T53
-   very useful mid-phrase

## Practical note

Listen for the bass (III): it often connects smoothly to IV (subdominant area).

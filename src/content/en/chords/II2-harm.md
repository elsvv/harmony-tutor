# II2-harm — Supertonic 2 chord in harmonic major

## How to read the label

`II2-harm` breaks down as:

-   `II` — the scale degree (supertonic), used here as a predominant sonority.
-   `2` — the “2 chord” inversion of a 7th chord (third inversion): the **7th** is in the bass, and the figure highlights the interval of a **2nd** above the bass.
-   `-harm` — harmonic major color: the lowered 6th degree (♭6) is used, creating a characteristic pull **♭6 → 5**.

## Structure

Third inversion of the II-degree 7th chord in **harmonic major** (lowered 6th):

-   **I** — in the bass (7th of the chord)
-   **II** — root
-   **IV** — 3rd
-   **♭VI** — 5th (lowered!)

## Harmonic major color

Lowered **VI** turns the chord into a darker, more tense predominant sonority:

-   diminished 5th between II and ♭VI
-   stronger pull toward the dominant

## Practical note

Make the characteristic half-step clear: **♭VI → V**.

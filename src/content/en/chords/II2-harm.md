# II2-harm — Supertonic 2 chord in harmonic major

## Structure

Third inversion of the II-degree 7th chord in **harmonic major** (lowered 6th):

-   **I** — in the bass (7th of the chord)
-   **II** — root
-   **IV** — 3rd
-   **♭VI** — 5th (lowered!)

## Harmonic major color

Lowered **VI** turns the chord into a darker, more tense predominant sonority:

-   diminished 5th between II and ♭VI
-   stronger pull toward the dominant

## Practical note

Make the characteristic half-step clear: **♭VI → V**.

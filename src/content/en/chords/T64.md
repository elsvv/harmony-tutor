# T64 — Tonic 6-4 (second inversion)

## How to read the label

`T64` can be read as:

-   `T` — tonic function.
-   `64` — second inversion triad (“6-4”): intervals of a **6th** and **4th** above the bass; the **5th** of the chord is in the bass.

## Structure

**Second inversion** tonic triad (the fifth is in the bass):

-   **V** — in the bass
-   **I**
-   **III**

## Function

Although built from tonic notes, T64 is often **unstable** and behaves like a preparation toward predominant/dominant harmony.

## Practical note

Treat it as a “decorated” tonic: it wants to move on, not to stop.

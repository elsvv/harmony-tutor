# T64 — Tonic 6-4 (second inversion)

## Structure

**Second inversion** tonic triad (the fifth is in the bass):

-   **V** — in the bass
-   **I**
-   **III**

## Function

Although built from tonic notes, T64 is often **unstable** and behaves like a preparation toward predominant/dominant harmony.

## Practical note

Treat it as a “decorated” tonic: it wants to move on, not to stop.

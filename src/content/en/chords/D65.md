# D65 — Dominant seventh in first inversion

## Structure

First inversion of D7 (the 3rd is in the bass):

-   **VII** — in the bass
-   **II**
-   **IV**
-   **V**

## Interval content (from the bass)

-   3rd
-   5th
-   6th

## Function

Still **dominant**, but often smoother in the bass line:

-   bass on VII strongly leads to I
-   very common inside cadences

## Practical note

Resolve the tendency tones:

-   bass (VII) → I
-   the 7th (IV) → III

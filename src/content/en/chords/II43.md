# II43 — Supertonic seventh chord, second inversion (4-3)

## How to read the label

`II43` breaks down as:

-   `II` — the scale degree (supertonic), used here as a predominant sonority.
-   `43` — the 4–3 figured-bass inversion of a 7th chord (second inversion): the **5th** of the chord is in the bass.

## Structure

Second inversion of the II-degree seventh chord:

-   **♭VI** — in the bass (5th of the chord, harmonic major color)
-   **I**
-   **II**
-   **IV**

## Function

A sharp-sounding predominant chord.

## Practical note

Because **♭VI** is in the bass, the progression to V often features a very clear half-step bass motion **♭VI → V**.

# T53 — Tonic triad

## Structure

**Root position** tonic triad:

-   **Root** (scale degree I) — in the bass
-   **Third** (scale degree III)
-   **Fifth** (scale degree V)

## Interval content

-   Major 3rd between I and III
-   Minor 3rd between III and V
-   Perfect 5th between I and V

## Function

**Tonic** is the tonal center: maximum stability, no need to resolve.

## Figured bass “53”

Intervals above the bass:

-   **5** = fifth above
-   **3** = third above

## Practical note

Keep the **third** present — it defines major/minor color.

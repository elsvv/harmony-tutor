# II65 — Supertonic seventh chord, first inversion

## Structure

First inversion of the II-degree seventh chord:

-   **IV** — in the bass (3rd of the chord)
-   **♭VI** — 5th (harmonic major color)
-   **I** — 7th
-   **II** — root

## Function

Predominant (subdominant group) with a very singable, smooth bass.

## Voice-leading idea

-   keep the bass (IV) common when possible
-   highlight **♭VI → V** on the move to the dominant

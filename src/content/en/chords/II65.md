# II65 — Supertonic seventh chord, first inversion

## How to read the label

`II65` breaks down as:

-   `II` — the scale degree (supertonic), used here as a predominant sonority.
-   `65` — first inversion of a 7th chord (6–5): the **3rd** of the chord is in the bass; the figures reflect characteristic intervals above the bass.

## Structure

First inversion of the II-degree seventh chord:

-   **IV** — in the bass (3rd of the chord)
-   **♭VI** — 5th (harmonic major color)
-   **I** — 7th
-   **II** — root

## Function

Predominant (subdominant group) with a very singable, smooth bass.

## Voice-leading idea

-   keep the bass (IV) common when possible
-   highlight **♭VI → V** on the move to the dominant

# D7 — Dominant seventh chord

## How to read the label

`D7` can be read as:

-   `D` — dominant function.
-   `7` — a 7th chord in root position: the root is in the bass and the chord includes a 7th above the bass (a key source of tension).

## Structure

Root position dominant seventh (built on scale degree V):

-   **V** — in the bass (root)
-   **VII** — the 3rd (leading tone)
-   **II** — the 5th
-   **IV** — the 7th

## Function

**Dominant** = strongest pull back to tonic:

-   contains the **tritone** (VII–IV)
-   leading tone (VII) resolves to I
-   the 7th (IV) resolves down to III

## Resolution (typical)

-   VII → I
-   IV → III

## Practical note

If you hear the tritone resolve clearly, the cadence will sound convincing.

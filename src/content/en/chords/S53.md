# S53 — Subdominant triad

## How to read the label

`S53` can be read as:

-   `S` — subdominant / predominant function (moving away from tonic, preparing dominant).
-   `53` — root position triad (intervals of a 5th and a 3rd above the bass).

## Structure

**Root position** subdominant triad:

-   **IV** — in the bass
-   **VI**
-   **I**

## Function

**Subdominant / predominant**:

-   moves away from tonic stability
-   prepares dominant harmony

## Practical note

IV in the bass is a very typical “predominant” bass degree.

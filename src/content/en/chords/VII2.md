# VII2 — Leading-tone seventh chord, third inversion (2 chord)

## How to read the label

`VII2` breaks down as:

-   `VII` — the scale degree (leading tone).
-   `2` — the “2 chord” inversion of a 7th chord (third inversion): the **7th** is in the bass; the figure highlights the interval of a **2nd** above the bass.

## Structure

Third inversion of the leading-tone 7th chord:

-   **♭VI** — in the bass (7th; harmonic-major color)
-   **VII**
-   **II**
-   **IV**

## Function

One of the sharpest dominant sonorities:

-   bass (♭VI) tends strongly to **V**

## Practical note

Make the bass half-step **♭VI → V** clear when moving into the dominant.

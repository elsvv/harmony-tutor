# III7 — Secondary dominant (dominant chains)

## What it is

**III7** is a dominant seventh chord built on the 3rd degree. In major keys it’s typically non-diatonic and functions as a **secondary dominant**, leading to VI.

In C major:

-   III7 = E7

## Typical motion

In the Rhythm Changes bridge (dominant chain):

-   III7 → VI7 → II7 → V7

## Why it matters

Each dominant pulls to the next one around the circle of fifths, creating strong forward motion.

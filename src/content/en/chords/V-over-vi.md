# V/vi — Secondary dominant to vi

## How to read the label

`V/vi` breaks down as:

-   `V` — the dominant chord.
-   `/vi` — “of vi”: the target chord is `vi`.

So `V/vi` means “dominant of vi” (a secondary dominant): it’s typically a dominant 7th chord that resolves to `vi`.

## What it is

**V/vi** (“five of six”) is a dominant 7th chord that resolves to the **vi** chord.

In C major:

-   V/vi = **E7**
-   vi = **Am7**

## Where you hear it

-   dominant chains (e.g., the Rhythm Changes bridge)
-   turnarounds and passing dominants

## Why it works

It adds strong pull toward the next chord via leading tone and tritone (dominant function).

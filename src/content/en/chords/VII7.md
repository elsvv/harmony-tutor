# VII7 — Leading-tone diminished seventh chord

## How to read the label

`VII7` breaks down as:

-   `VII` — the scale degree (leading tone): the chord is built on degree 7.
-   `7` — a 7th chord in root position (the chord root is in the bass).

## Structure

Root position leading-tone 7th chord (as used in these lessons, with harmonic-major color):

-   **VII** — in the bass (leading tone)
-   **II**
-   **IV**
-   **♭VI** — 7th (lowered 6th degree)

## Function

A very strong **dominant-function** chord:

-   contains a tritone (VII–IV)
-   multiple half-step tendencies

## Resolution idea

-   VII → I
-   ♭VI → V (characteristic)

## Practical note

Let it ring: VII7 is often the peak of tension before resolution.

# II65-harm — Supertonic 6-5 chord in harmonic major

## How to read the label

`II65-harm` breaks down as:

-   `II` — the scale degree (supertonic), used here as a predominant sonority.
-   `65` — first inversion of a 7th chord (6–5): the **3rd** of the chord is in the bass; the figures reflect characteristic intervals above the bass.
-   `-harm` — harmonic major color: the lowered 6th degree (♭6) is used, often creating a clear tendency **♭6 → 5**.

## Structure

First inversion of the II-degree 7th chord in **harmonic major**:

-   **IV** — in the bass
-   **♭VI** — lowered 6th degree (key color)
-   **I**
-   **II**

## Function

Predominant with a “minor shade” inside a major key.

## Voice-leading to V

-   **♭VI → V** (descending half-step — crucial)
-   bass (IV) may stay or move toward V/III depending on context

## Practical note

If you emphasize the half-step **♭VI → V**, the harmonic-major flavor becomes obvious.

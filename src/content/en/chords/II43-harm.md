# II43-harm — Supertonic 4-3 chord in harmonic major

## Structure

Second inversion of the II-degree 7th chord (4-3) in **harmonic major**:

-   **♭VI** — in the bass (lowered!)
-   **I**
-   **II**
-   **IV**

## Function

A tense predominant sonority.

## Practical note

Because the lowered 6th is in the bass, the move to the dominant often features a very clear bass half-step: **♭VI → V**.

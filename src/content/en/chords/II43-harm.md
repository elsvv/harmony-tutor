# II43-harm — Supertonic 4-3 chord in harmonic major

## How to read the label

`II43-harm` breaks down as:

-   `II` — the scale degree (supertonic). In these lessons it functions as a predominant sonority.
-   `43` — the 4–3 figured-bass inversion of a 7th chord (second inversion): the 5th of the chord is in the bass.
-   `-harm` — “harmonic major” color: the lowered 6th degree (♭6) is used, which often creates a clear bass half-step **♭6 → 5**.

## Structure

Second inversion of the II-degree 7th chord (4-3) in **harmonic major**:

-   **♭VI** — in the bass (lowered!)
-   **I**
-   **II**
-   **IV**

## Function

A tense predominant sonority.

## Practical note

Because the lowered 6th is in the bass, the move to the dominant often features a very clear bass half-step: **♭VI → V**.

# S6 — Subdominant in first inversion

## Structure

First inversion of the subdominant triad:

-   **VI** — in the bass
-   **I**
-   **IV**

## Function

A smooth predominant sonority, often used to keep the bass line stepwise.

## Practical note

S6 is a common way to approach predominant 7th chords (like II43) while holding VI in the bass.
